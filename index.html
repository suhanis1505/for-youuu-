  <h2>Why I Love You</h2>

  <div class="why-cards">

    <div class="why-card">
      I love you because I felt safe with you from the very beginning.  
      With you, I never had to pretend or change myself.  
      I could just be me — and that was enough.
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
      Even on my worst days, 10–20 minutes on a video call with you can make
      everything feel lighter. Your presence alone calms me more than anything else.
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
      You make distance feel survivable.
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
      I love you because of your consistency and determination towards your goals and dreams.
      You show up. You don’t give up.
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
      You feel like home in ways I can’t explain.
      The kind of comfort and safety that doesn’t need words —
      like it was always meant to be this way.
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
      You make me feel protected, wanted, and deeply loved.
      At the same time, you push me towards my goals instead of holding me back.
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
      I overthink everything — every small thing.
      I always believed no one would have the patience to handle that.
      But you do. You stay. You reassure me.
      You make my overthinking feel safe instead of wrong.
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
      Even though you’re not obligated to stay or handle me, you still do.
      You handle my tantrums with love, just like I handle yours —
      and that mutual effort makes us feel like a real team.
