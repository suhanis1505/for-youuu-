    <!-- Why I Love You -->

  <h2>Why I Love You</h2>

  <div class="why-cards">

    <div class="why-card">
    You were the one who fell first, but somehow you made it 
    feel safe enough for me to fall too, and harder i would say.
    Nothing ever felt forced with you. It just felt natural, like 
    I had known you forever (not copy- paste, i mean it).
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
    My day genuinely feels incomplete without you.
    Even a 10-minute call from you is enough to fix 
    everything. Those small calls are the highlight 
    of my entire day, like yours is TMKOC .
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
    I overthink everything. But you never get tired of me, 
    And i wish and hope that u never will 🤞🏻
    You stay, you listen, and you calmly reassure me.
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
    I admire how focused and consistent you are towards your 
    goal and dream. Your determination, your maturity, your loyalty,
    and the love you have for your family. It makes me respect you even more.
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
      You feel like home in ways I can’t explain.
      The kind of comfort and safety that doesn’t need words 
      like it was always meant to be this way.
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
      Even when we fight or I’m upset with you,
      you don’t give up.
      You keep calling again and again until I’m okay.
      It annoys me… but in the most comforting way.
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
      I love your calmness.
      And I love how you’re funny at the same time.
      The way you roast me, make silly faces, sing all genre songs randomly
      and act childish just to make me laugh.
      I secretly hope you never stop doing that.
    </div>

    <div class="why-card">
      But more than anything,
      I love you because with you I feel safe.
      I feel calm.
      I feel loved.
      And I feel like home.
